Will be uploading the latest pipeline to this directory
Please make the repo public for me to upload my pipeline.
Finally, the file is in GitHub and in its right folder. 
I don't know if you know how to move things in and out of folders I just learned it so if you want me to I can write a quick Tutorial note. 
I will mention it in my notes tho.
Okay, I restored the pykosmos functions in the pipeline. the file with 0710 is the newest one that you can use.
I would be mentioning dates in the name so that it is easier to track which one is the latest.
I posted the new clean pipeline but it has some errors that I am working on trouble shooting.
I did the silly idea and now the pipeline is working with the old apextract. I renamed it to be apextract_re.py.
Added the H17_47 star spectra.
I re-ran the code for Rv-2 and put the new notebook as the 0718 seems to be invalid for some reason.
